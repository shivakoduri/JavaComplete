/**
 * 
 * The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development.
 * It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical
 * instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used to: -
 * avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the
 * abstract factory pattern does. - avoid the inherent cost of creating a new
 * object in the standard way (e.g., using the 'new' keyword)
 * <p>
 * In this example we have a factory class ({@link HeroFactoryImpl}) producing
 * objects by cloning the existing ones. The factory's prototype objects are
 * given as constructor parameters.
